## Description
For this project I've made a simple multiple choice code quiz, using JavaScript to dynamically update the HTML throughout the quiz. The user
is given 30 seconds to answer a series of multiple choice questions, then a score is calculated and the user is able to enter their initials
alongside their quiz score. This is one of my first projects utilizing JavaScript and while it was difficult, it was a lot of fun to create.
